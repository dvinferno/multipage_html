      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Gold Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most infamous
        being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by
        the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last
        words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in
        the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the
        Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which
        promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the
        most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the
        Pirate King. Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your
        standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a
        wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun,
        Luffyâ€™s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of
        an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with
        finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in
        the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across
        the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries
        and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.
