      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Naruto Uzumaki, a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja, lives in
        Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf village. Moments prior to his birth, a
        huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-tailed Fox, attacked
        Konohagakure and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's
        rampage, the leader of the village, the 4th Hokage, sacrificed his life
        and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto. Shunned
        because of the presence of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to
        find his place in the village. He strives to become the Hokage of
        Konohagakure, and he meets many friends and foes along the way.
